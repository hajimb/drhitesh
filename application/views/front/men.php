                <p class="text-justify">Premature Ejaculation is essentially an early orgasmic response, due to fast pace of excitement, resulting in quick achieving of orgasm and hence ejaculation. It reflects lack of control on force / pace or sexual excitement rather than lack of strength.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Reasons:</p>
                <p class="text-justify">1. Local hypersensitivity of glans.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">2. Constitutionally many individuals are known to react fast, sexually.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">3. Previous history of masturbation where one is habituated to masturbate to quickly to orgasm; and, then it becomes a self repetitive response pattern in any sexual encounter, too.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">4. Lack of stamina and fitness. Including due to overweight, hypertension and cardiac disorders.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">5. Stress and hurried nature.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Solution: With our innovative and scientific approach we have made a classic breakthrough, which help you permanently improve and change your fast pace of excitement to a moderate one, which naturally prolongs your timings in each sexual encounter.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">This triggers severe performance pressure and performance anxiety in many men. During their foreplay, instead of being spontaneous and sensuous, they tend to become conscious and nervous. This further takes away their arousal and creates more problem with erection. This escalates anxiety.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Thus a vicious circle develops.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">And, ultimately men start avoiding – thus enters ‘avoidance phase or avoidance behavior’! On other hand the partner also undergoes her misery.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Initially she is supportive and keeps patience. But when repeatedly finding herself left high and dry and finding the male partner getting disappointed and embarrassed, ultimately she also suppresses her desire or looses interest.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">And, as a couple the romance takes back foot and the chemistry goes downhill spiral. Ultimately they loose hope and become frustrated and depressed.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">There is a classical way to come out of this state and rekindle love, romance and passion. Couple can very soon experience spontaneity and sensuality. And, experience fulfilling sex life.</p>

                <p class="lineheight28">Phimosis is tight foreskin which can not be retracted back on the glans (head or the front part of the penis) penis.</p>
                <p class="lineheight28">This creates difficulty during intercourse leading to pain, distraction and loss of erection and most of th time making vaginal penetration (insertion) of penis, impossible. A forceful intercourse can even result in bleeding from frenulum.</p>
                <p>Generally these cases are advised circumcision. But, we treat phimosis without surgery in 99 % cases unless it a a very very tight foreskin with pin hole opening.</p>
                <p class="lineheight28">Why its important to preserve foreskin and avoid circumcision:</p>
                <p class="lineheight28">The rubbing of an elastic and normal foreskin gives a very fine quality of pleasure during intercourse (in and out movement of penis leads the rubbing of foreskin on the glans penis).</p>
                <p class="lineheight28">Paraphimosis is a condition where, when the foreskin is retracted back but can not be put back to original place. This leads to severe swelling and other severe complications. Generally this is a surgical emergency but most of such cases we treat without surgery through our innovative approach and help person to preserve foreskin which is an excellent source of fine pleasure.</p>
